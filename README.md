## Hey! 🖐️
My name is Bára Sochorová and I love to do everything and nothing at the same time! Sounds weird? Well… it is, but that’s just who I am ⭐

I’m a primarly graphic designer, but I love to explore new things! One day I animate, the next I try game design, and sometimes I convince myself I can code.

> I crave chaos and curiosity!

But sometimes it’s not about what I can do — it’s about what we can create together.💫

Here you can explore my portfolio — enjoy! 🧚‍♀️
