# First Impressions ✴️

In the previous assignment, we designed a paper business card. This became the starting point for our handshake and About page. Together, these elements create a strong first impression and clearly show who we are.

## Handshake

Versions: 
- My name is Bára Sochorová and I am a graphic-motion-game designer.
- My name is Bára Sochorová and I love to do everything and nothing at the same time! It can sound weird, but Its completly true!
I am primarily a graphic designer. But I am very passionate, so from time to time I love to explore and learn new things like motion design, game design, coding and so on.

### Actual version:

My name is Bára Sochorová and I love to do everything and nothing at the same time! Sounds weird? Well… it is, but that’s just who I am.
I’m a primarly graphic designer, but I love to explore new things! One day I animate, the next I try game design, and sometimes I convince myself I can code.
